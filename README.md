## What's the UMSR?
The UMSR is a private Minecraft Server founded in 2019 with the goal of developing an efficient in-game economic and political system which facilitates growth and allows people to have more fun by avoiding bording tasks. The server implements a free market economy with its own currency, central bank, government, private corporations and financial markets.

## Why NSE Market System?
Since 2020, people on the server have been using a proprietary market management system to trade in in-game financial instruments using exclusively in-game money. However, the system needed to be repalced due to software shortcomings and had to be rewritten from the ground up.
In-game financial markets enhance liquidity and reduced overall volatility in the economy, allowing for more rapid growth and more efficient allocation of resources.
